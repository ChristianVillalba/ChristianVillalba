### Nice to meet you

My name is Christian     
As you can see in my latest commits, I am learning 
* React   

I already learnt some:
* Python
* Django
* JavaScript
* ES6 & jQuery
* HTML 
* CSS
* Bootstrap   

But I am interested in more technologies:

* PHP
* NodeJS
* SQL & MongoDB (databases in general)

I love learning and improve my coding skills.    
any suggestion or feedback is welcome

Have a good day!
